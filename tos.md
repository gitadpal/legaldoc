## 2. Description of Services

### 2.1 Overview

The App provides a permissionless platform that enables users to cast images to compatible e-ink phone case displays via Near Field Communication ("NFC") technology, connect external cryptocurrency wallets via the WalletConnect protocol, participate in advertising reward programs, and engage with decentralized smart contract-based advertising campaigns.

### 2.2 E-Ink Display Casting

The App allows you to select images stored on your device and cast them to a compatible e-ink display attached to your phone case. This functionality operates locally on your device and does not require internet connectivity or transmission of images to our servers.

### 2.3 Wallet Integration

The App provides an interface for connecting external cryptocurrency wallets through the WalletConnect protocol. The App does not create, manage, custody, or store cryptocurrency wallets or private keys. All wallet functionality, security, and custody remain the sole responsibility of you and your chosen external wallet application.

### 2.4 Advertising Programs

The App offers optional participation in advertising reward programs, as more fully described in Section 6 of these Terms.

## 3. Permissionless Nature of the App

### 3.1 No Registration Required

Core functionality of the App, specifically the casting of images to your e-ink display, does not require account registration, submission of personal information, or connection to our backend services.

### 3.2 Optional Features

Certain optional features, including participation in advertising programs and receipt of fiat currency rewards, may require connection of an external wallet, submission of additional personal information, and agreement to supplementary terms.

### 3.3 User Autonomy

You retain full control over your participation in optional features. We do not require you to participate in advertising programs to use the core functionality of the App.

## 4. Wallet Connection and Cryptocurrency

### 4.1 External Wallet Requirement

To participate in certain features of the App, including advertising reward programs, you must connect a compatible external cryptocurrency wallet via the WalletConnect protocol.

### 4.2 No Custody

The Company does not provide wallet or custody services. We do not hold, control, manage, or have access to your private keys, seed phrases, passwords, or any other credentials associated with your wallet. You are solely responsible for the security and management of your wallet and all assets contained therein.

### 4.3 Wallet Security

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your wallet credentials, that any transactions initiated from your connected wallet are authorized by you, that the Company is not liable for any loss of cryptocurrency or other assets resulting from unauthorized access to your wallet, compromise of your credentials, or your failure to maintain adequate security measures, and that you will not hold the Company responsible for any issues arising from your use of third-party wallet applications.

### 4.4 Blockchain Transactions

Transactions conducted on blockchain networks are irreversible. Once a transaction is confirmed on-chain, it cannot be cancelled, reversed, or modified. You acknowledge that you understand the nature of blockchain technology and accept the risks associated with irreversible transactions.

### 4.5 Gas Fees and Network Costs

You are solely responsible for all gas fees, network transaction fees, and other costs associated with blockchain transactions initiated through your wallet. The Company does not control and is not responsible for blockchain network fees.

## 5. E-Ink Display Functionality

### 5.1 Compatible Hardware

The e-ink display casting feature requires a compatible e-ink phone case display that supports NFC communication. The Company does not warrant compatibility with all devices or e-ink displays.

### 5.2 Local Processing

Images cast to your e-ink display are processed locally on your device. The Company does not upload, store, access, or transmit your images to any server or third party in connection with this feature.

### 5.3 User Content

You are solely responsible for the images you cast to your e-ink display. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to use such images and that your use does not infringe the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party.

### 5.4 No Liability for Display Issues

The Company is not responsible for any malfunction, damage, or failure of your e-ink display or phone case hardware. Hardware warranties, if any, are provided by the hardware manufacturer and not by the Company.

## 6. Advertising Programs

### 6.1 Overview

The App offers optional participation in advertising reward programs through which you may earn cryptocurrency tokens, points, or fiat currency by engaging with advertisements.

### 6.2 Third-Party Advertising Network

The App integrates with third-party advertising providers to deliver link-based advertisements. Advertisements are routed through our backend services. You may choose to view and click on advertisements. Upon valid engagement, you may earn rewards as determined by the applicable advertising partner and subject to their terms. The Company facilitates the delivery of advertisements and coordination of rewards but does not control the content, accuracy, or legitimacy of third-party advertisements. You engage with third-party advertisements at your own risk.

### 6.3 Smart Contract-Based Advertising

The App enables participation in decentralized advertising campaigns published on public blockchain networks ("On-Chain Advertising").

**Campaign Structure.** Advertisers publish advertising campaigns to public smart contracts, specifying campaign terms, creative assets, required tasks, duration requirements, and reward allocations.

**Task Participation.** You may elect to participate in On-Chain Advertising campaigns by agreeing to cast advertiser-provided images to your e-ink display for specified consecutive time periods as required by the campaign.

**Compliance Review.** Our backend services review task completion to verify compliance with campaign requirements. Compliance review may include verification of casting duration, image accuracy, and adherence to campaign terms.

**Reward Distribution.** Upon successful completion and verification of advertising tasks, rewards are settled through the applicable smart contract. The Company facilitates compliance verification but does not control the smart contract or reward distribution mechanism.

**Service Fee.** The Company charges a service fee, deducted from advertiser allocations, for providing the advertising platform, compliance review services, and related infrastructure. The applicable service fee percentage will be disclosed within the App.

### 6.4 Advertiser Verification

In certain jurisdictions, the Company is required to conduct Know Your Business ("KYB") verification on advertisers before permitting them to publish On-Chain Advertising campaigns. Such verification is conducted on advertisers and does not require submission of business documentation by end users.

### 6.5 Message Protocol and Arbitration

The App utilizes an internal messaging protocol in connection with advertising reward settlement.

**Message Receipts.** The messaging protocol generates cryptographic receipts documenting task completion, compliance verification status, and reward entitlements.

**On-Chain Arbitration.** In the event that you complete an advertising task in accordance with campaign requirements and the applicable reward is not distributed, you may utilize message protocol receipts to initiate automated arbitration through the applicable smart contract. The arbitration mechanism operates on-chain and enables you to claim earned rewards directly from the smart contract, subject to the terms encoded in the smart contract.

**Arbitration Limitations.** The Company does not control the outcome of on-chain arbitration. Arbitration results are determined by the smart contract logic and the validity of submitted message receipts.

### 6.6 Fiat Rewards

If you elect to receive advertising rewards in fiat currency, you will be required to provide additional personal information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, and payment account details. Fiat reward payments are subject to applicable financial regulations, tax withholding requirements, and payment processor terms. The Company may impose minimum withdrawal thresholds and processing fees for fiat payments.

### 6.7 Reward Accuracy and Disputes

The Company endeavors to ensure accurate tracking and distribution of advertising rewards. However, you acknowledge that technical errors, network issues, or other factors may occasionally affect reward calculations. For third-party advertising rewards, disputes should be directed to the applicable advertising partner. For On-Chain Advertising rewards, the on-chain arbitration mechanism described in Section 6.5 provides the exclusive dispute resolution process.

### 6.8 No Guarantee of Rewards

The Company does not guarantee the availability, amount, or value of advertising rewards. Reward rates, availability, and terms are subject to change without notice. The value of cryptocurrency tokens may fluctuate significantly.

## 7. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities
